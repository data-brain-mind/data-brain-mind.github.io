            </div>
            <div class="margin">
                Our workshop aims to connect machine learning researchers with neuroscientists and cognitive scientists
                by focusing on concrete, open problems grounded in emerging datasets of neural and/or behavioral data in
                humans and other animals. As in other computational sciences, these large-scale, open datasets are
                transforming the practice of research in a variety of subdomains, including whole-brain circuitry,
                visual-motor cortical processing, human development, and natural speech processing. We believe that a
                workshop focused on concrete and accessible problems via open datasets can catalyze timely and
                high-impact connections among domain scientists in neuroscience and cognitive science and ML
                practitioners. Our data-driven approach is motivated by substantial existing work on ML for neuroscience
                and cognitive science, including in data analysis and in the development of normative models.
                Foundational work has already established conceptual frameworks and standardized evaluations that have
                advanced our understanding of neural computation for cognition. Combined with the growth of
                high-resolution, large-scale datasets in both neuroscience and cognitive science, we believe a workshop
                focused on concrete, applied problems is timely and presents a clear opportunity to forge
                collaborations. We envision outcomes such as applying ML to large behavioral datasets, analyzing
                clinical conditions like Parkinson's disease through reinforcement learning frameworks, and developing
                ML models for stroke and grasping studies.

            <p>We invite 4-page submissions in three categories:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Dataset Papers:</b> Submissions should present neuroscience or cognitive science datasets that
                    clearly articulate open scientific questions the dataset could address, highlight connections to
                    relevant computational or machine learning approaches, provide well-formatted and accessible data
                    (such as pandas DataFrames or standardized formats), and may include previously published datasets
                    if they identify new questions. Examples of dataset papers include: neural recording datasets with
                    specific hypotheses about computation, behavioral datasets with questions about learning mechanisms,
                    and clinical datasets with therapeutic targets.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Method Papers:</b> Submissions should present machine learning methods with clear applications to
                    neuroscience or cognitive science, including novel algorithms with potential for experimental
                    testing, adaptations of existing methods to domain-specific problems, theoretical frameworks that
                    could guide experimental design, and tools for standardized evaluation—building toward an "ImageNet
                    for neuroscience."
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Problem Statements:</b> We welcome position papers and proposals of untested ideas that identify
                    concrete open problems requiring interdisciplinary collaboration, propose experimental frameworks
                    informed by computational theory, suggest new evaluation paradigms or benchmarks, and aim to bridge
                    gaps between the neuroscience, cognitive science, and machine learning communities.

His group has developed some of the foremost algorithms and analysis for self-supervised RL methods which enable agents to learn intelligent behaviors without labels or human supervision. Before joining Princeton, he got his PhD in machine learning at CMU under Ruslan Salakhutdinov and Sergey Levine and supported by the NSF GFRP and the Hertz Fellowship. -->
        <!-- \item \textbf{Jenelle Feather} ({\ttfamily\href{mailto:jfeather@cmu.edu}{jfeather@cmu.edu}}) is an incoming Assistant Professor in the Neuroscience Institute and Psychology Department at Carnegie Mellon University (Fall 2025). She is currently a Flatiron Research Fellow at the Center for Computational Neuroscience (CCN) working with SueYeon Chung and Eero Simoncelli. She received her Ph.D. in 2022 in brain and cognitive sciences at MIT working in the Laboratory for Computational Audition with Josh McDermott. During that time she was a Friends of McGovern Institute Graduate Fellow as part of the McGovern Institute, a DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellow and was affiliated with the Center for Brains Minds and Machines. Jenelle has been a lead organizer for the MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences Computational Tutorials (2016-2021), a Cosyne workshop (2020), and the upcoming Flatiron Junior Theoretical Neuroscience workshop (2025). She has also served on program committees for Cognitive Computational Neuroscience (2025) and for numerous workshops at NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML. --> 
        <!-- \item \textbf{Erin Grant} ({\ttfamily\href{mailto:erin.grant@ucl.ac.uk}{erin.grant@ucl.ac.uk}}) is a Senior Research Fellow at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour and the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London. Erin studies prior nowledge and learning mechanisms in minds and machines using a combination of behavioral experiments, computational simulations, and analytical techniques, with the goal of grounding higher-level cognitive phenomena in a neural implementation. Erin earned her Ph.D.~in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, and during her Ph.D., spent time at OpenAI, Google Brain, and DeepMind. --> 
        <!-- {\color{purple}{Erin has co-organized 8 workshops at NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR: the hybrid (2018, 2020) and virtual (2021) NeurIPS \href{http://metalearning.ml/}{Workshops on Meta-Learning}; the hybrid ICLR 2019 \href{https://eringrant.github.io/spirl}{Workshop on Structure \& Priors in RL}; the virtual NeurIPS 2020 \href{https://wimlworkshop.org/neurips2020/}{Women in Machine Learning Affinity Workshop}; the in-person \href{https://representational-alignment.github.io/}{ICLR 2024 Re-Align Workshop}, and the in-person \href{https://iclworkshop.github.io/}{ICML 2024 Workshop on In-Context Learning}. She has also served on the program committee for 23 workshops at ACL, ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS. Erin has led diversity and inclusion at machine learning conferences as a Diversity, Inclusion \& Accessibility Chair at NeurIPS 2022, 2023, and 2025 and a Diversity, Equity \& Inclusion Chair at ICLR 2024 and ICLR 2025.}} -->
